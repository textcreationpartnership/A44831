            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe are they who are without God in the world,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.12.2, 3.</note> they only are lead by the power of the prince of darkneſs; the God of this world hath blinded their eyes, hardned their hearts; yea and they are ſealed up unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting condemnation, and yet know it not, and yet theſe muſt paſs for Chriſtians: O let theſe know that it will be eaſier for <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the day of Judgment then for them.</p>

I am certain where the power of godlineſs rules, it will make a man as zealous againſt every ſin as any ſin: but for a man to be zealous onely againſt ſuch ſins as ſtrike at himſelf in point of profit, credit, or eſteem, ſuch a mans zeal is not for God, but for himſelf: ſo that we may well ſay, ſin is not puniſhed becauſe it is ſin, but becauſe ſuch and ſuch men fear that they ſhall ſuffer by it: as for a Miniſter to be very forward in puniſhing the ſin of drunkenneſs, in ſuch of his pariſhoners as deſert their own pariſh Church on the Lords day, and

go to <hi>Iſlington</hi> or elſewhere to hear, and yet is conſcious of the ſame vice in many others of his pariſh which conſtantly hear him, who ſhall go free and unqueſtioned; this is not ſo much for their being drunk, as for their going from their own pariſh; in like maner there be ſome that be very ready to inflict puniſhment on thoſe that reſort not unto publike meetings at their own pariſh Church, but frequent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings; yet they can obſerve and know of many that ſpend the Lords days in carouſing, and revelling, both at home and in the Ale-houſes, and yet can ſalve up ſuch prophaneſſes, and paſs them by unpuniſhed: this is not to puniſh ſin becauſe it is ſinful, but that it may be ſerviceable and advantagious to ſome ſiniſter end or other; for were the puniſhment out of a conſcientious deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſin, then would it not be partial, or particular, but univerſal, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons or place; Again, thoſe that would have them puniſhed for meeting in private at any time to confer about matters of Religion, therefore accounting them broachers and fomenters of error, can at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times wink at, and be privy unto the prophane meetings of ſwearers, drunkards, and blaſphemers of the moſt high God, and

of treacherous and bloody conſpirators, both againſt the Church and State; nay, it may be they themſelves the principal agents in ſuch deſperate and unwarrantable deſigns: this is not the true way to puniſh the ſin of Error as they pretend, for if it were, then drunkenneſs, ſwearing, blaſphemy, Teaſon and conſpiracy, being all as great, nay greater errors, ſhould have a ſhare, if not a larger proportion of puniſhment.

            <p>Again, Chriſts blood was really ſhed for his Saints, and not for the world, of which <hi>Judas</hi> was one; for if Chriſt would not pray for the world, certainly muchleſs would he die for the world: We will not ſay, but the price of Chriſts blood was ſufficient for the redemption of ten thouſand worlds; but yet we will ſay it was onely intended and ſhed for his Elect ones.</p>

            <p>There are two things in this point to be unfolded.</p>

            <p>

            <p>We have ſpoken ſomewhat of the firſt in the former part, in the explicating of the words; and now we will ſomewhat enlarge upon it.</p>
            <p>Godlineſs is the right exerciſing and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe graces which the ſoul hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Godlineſs what it is.</note> both to the glory of God, and good of man, or the bringing forth of the fruits of grace in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life and converſation; that is, when a man improves all his graces given unto him to the advantage of his Maſter Chriſt,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95179:60"/>
to be glad of every occaſion whereby he may advance the glory of that God, that hath advanced him by the glory of his grace: as God is pleaſed to ſhew the glory of his grace to a ſoul, and that to the utmoſt, ſo godlineſs in that ſoul deſires to improve and actuate all that grace and mercy to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt power, to and for God, Chriſt, the Goſpel, and the Saints; And this is the very life and ſoul of godlineſs, and this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual courſe that godlineſs acts, this is its full ſcope and aime; the perfection of this, is that which it doth aſpire after: for this is the ſouls breathings from the time that the ſoul received it, unto the end of life, and ſo godlineſs becomes the ſouls witneſs here, and hereafter,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note> for it hath the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, This godlineſs comes, I ſay it comes into the ſoul of man, it is not attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by induſtry atchieved, nor is it inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in any ſoul: but it is grace poured out from God, and freely given and breathed into the ſoul of man by the Spirit of grace; <hi>I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh,</hi>

            <p>We have now ſeen, that godlineſs where it comes, it comes, freely and comes with power; the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is, how it comes to paſs that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs comes with ſo much power into the ſoul.</p>

            <p>When thou art going out of thy doors, think with thy ſelf, whether am I now going? every ſtep I take this day is toward Eternity: what, am I going to my companions to the Tavern or Alehouſe? O certainly theſe paths lead to the chambers of death? what am I going to poiſon my ſoul yet more and more, to bring more guilt upon my ſpirit, to wound my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience yet more? O this is not the way to take off that guilt that lies upon my ſpirit, this is not the way to give thanks to God who hath kept me this night from danger, who hath yet ſaved my ſoul from hell; O thus far natural men may eaſily go, who have not one dram of grace; then covenant with thy ſelf, and ſay, Well, is it ſo? I will not keep company this day, I am reſolved to gainſay all occaſions to draw me to it; This reſolution being taken and kept for two dayes, then for three dayes, for a week, then for a moneth, ſo by degrees thou maiſt get the victory.
